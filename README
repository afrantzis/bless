3. Requirements
---------------

The main target platform for bless is GNU/Linux. However, all the libraries it
uses are cross-platform, so bless should be able to run without problems 
on all the major platforms (GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Win32).

To build and run the current version of bless you need:
    * GTK+ >= 2.8.x (Included in all modern GNU/Linux distributions, http://www.gtk.org)
    * mono/.NET runtime and C# compiler >= 1.1.14 (http://www.mono-project.com)
    * Gtk# bindings >= 2.8 for GTK+ (http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net)
    * pkg-config (Included in all modern GNU/Linux distributions)
    
Development is done using the latest stable versions of the above libraries. 
Although using an older version may be OK, there is no guarantee that there 
will not be problems.

4. Installation
---------------
Quick: 
    untar, ./configure, make, (make install)

Detailed:

Step 1: Untar the source package
---------------------------------
For a tar.gz package use:
    tar -xzvf bless-a.b.c.tar.gz

For a tar.bz2 package use:
    tar -xjvf bless-a.b.c.tar.gz

Step 2: Configure the build
-----------------------------
Enter the directory created in the previous step (bless-a.b.c) and type
'./configure'. The script will check if your system has all the required
libraries. Use the "--prefix=*" option to set the installation directory prefix.
By default the prefix is '/usr/local'.

You can also use the "--enable-debug" option to build bless with debug
information.

Step 3: Build the program
-----------------------------
Type 'make'. This will create 'bless.exe' and the necessary library files in the
bin/ directory and the 'bless' launcher script in the bless-a.b.c directory. You
can also type 'make check' to run some tests on various bless components. 

Step 4: Install the program (optional)
--------------------------------------
Become root and type 'make install'.


----------
5. Running
----------
If you chose to install the program, just type 'bless'. In any case you can  
run the program by typing 'bless' in the 'bless-a.b.c' directory.
Enjoy!

6. Documentation
----------------

The doc/ directory contains documentation directed both at the user and at the 
developer who wants to explore Bless. The doc/user/ subdirectory contains 
information about using bless whereas doc/developer/ contains developer 
information (plugin development etc). 
Note: The developer documentation is almost non-existant.

7. Known Issues
---------------

* To be able to save a file under the same name (File->Save command) you need
  to have (temporarily) enough disk space to hold both the original and the
  new file. This happens because the new file is created in the /tmp 
  directory and then moved to its proper position. For example if you have a 
  20MB file and edit it so that it becomes 21MB and the new file is supposed to
  be saved in the same storage device as /tmp, you need to have 20+21=41MB free
  space in that storage device to be able to save it. After a successful save, 
  the original file is deleted, in this case freeing 20MB.
      Although this can be a problem (when there is not enough disk space), it 
  can also be seen as a safety measure in case something goes wrong when saving.
